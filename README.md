# MAAC (Mobile Apps Accessibility Checker)

ðŸ‘‰ [HackYeah](https://hackyeah.pl) task

Mobile applications should be digitally available to users with disabilities, which in practice means they must meet the requirements of WCAG 2.1. However, there is no simple IT tool that could inform the programmer or the person receiving the ordered application whether the application meets these requirements or not, or at least whether there are no gross errors of digital accessibility. We need such a validator for iOS and Android applications.
